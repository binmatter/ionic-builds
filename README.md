# Binmatter's Ionic Builds
Repository to build a Docker image used for Ionic builds.

**Why do we need a Docker image for building the apps?**

Containerizing all the dependencies is a life saver for developers, we don't have to configure everything in a local machine with specific versions for each technology needed. Just mount a container :)
