# Binmatter's Ionic Builds
Repository used to generate Docker images for Web, Android and iOS builds.

**Why do we need a Docker image for building the apps?**
Containerizing all the dependencies is a life saver for developers, we don't have to configure everything in a local machine with specific versions for each technology needed.
